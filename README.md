A GroupMe bot

### The Problem
Each week a group meets to have dinner together. I have been put in charge to setup planning of the meals.

Each week everyone brings a few dinner items. We all sign up on a Google Sheet. Dinners rotate every week, and I'm the one responsible for setting up the spreadsheet each week. What can be done when I always forget to setup the spreadsheet every week?

### The Bot
This is a bot that works with the GroupMe chat app. It does the following:
1. Once a week, the app clears the spreadsheet, and replaces it with the next meal in the rotation.
2. After the new spreadsheet it up, it sends a message to the group.
